# 3D Reconstruction of Binding Points in the Cage Machine

This repository contains the code and resources for the **three-dimensional reconstruction** of binding points within a **cylindrical steel cage**, produced by a Schnell cage machine. The project is part of an automated system for recognizing and robotically tying the intersection points between longitudinal rods and the spiral.

## Objective

Develop a pipeline capable of:

- Processing **point clouds** acquired from a **SICK Visionary T-Mini** camera.  
- Automatically detecting **horizontal and vertical rods** within the structure.  
- Calculating the **3D intersections** between rods to accurately identify the binding points.  
- Providing the **spatial coordinates** required for automated control of the tying machine.
